# Introduction
  * Who am I
  * Why this is important
    * JavaScript as lingua franca
      * cross-platform (via browser)
      * on server with node.js
      * expanding market (e.g. mongo)
    * Java devs are bad at JavaScript
      * See nc.js
  * Talk Format
    * Audience asks questions
    * Move at audience pace
    * Cover language basics
      * Equality
      * Scoping
      * Objects
      * Functions
      * this

# Order
  1. Equality
    * == and != not transitive
    * more predictable alternatives
  2. Scoping
    * Functions
    * No block scoping (e.g. for-loops)
  3. Objects
    * My original confusion
    * Bag 'o stuffs
    * Protoypal inheritance
    * prototype and [[prototype]]
  4. Object Creation
    * Object Literals
      * specs
    * Classical Object Creation
    * Object.create
    * Prototypal Object Creation
    * Functional Object Creation
  5. Functions
    * They're objects too
      * Hidden properties
        * context
        * code to execute
    * Function literals
  6. Invocation patterns
    * this
    * method
    * function
    * constructor
    * apply
