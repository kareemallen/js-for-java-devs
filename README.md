# JavaScript for Java Developers

Over the years JavaScript has gotten a terrible rap among Java developers.
From its horrible type coercion to its incessant global scoping, JavaScript is
full of pitfalls for those more accustomed to descendants of C++. Using Douglas
Crockford's "JavaScript the Good Parts" as a rough guide, I will give a brief
introduction of the language. I will show some of the common traps for Java developers,
along with how to properly mitigate those issues. Topics include: type coercion,
object creation, function invocation, and scoping.
